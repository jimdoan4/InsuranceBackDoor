  <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 19px;height: 54px;">10 Best Bachelor of Insurance & Risk Management Degree
    Programs</p>
  <p>There are currently somewhere between 50 and 70 RMI programs available in the United States, depending on whether
    one includes certificates and minors in their tally. But we weren’t looking for just any programs when we compiled
    our list; we wanted the best, which to us meant finding the schools with the most focused, comprehensive options
    for students who want to immerse themselves completely in this uniquely specialized field. Therefore, we did not
    consider BBA or BSBA degrees (which typically consist mainly of business courses with a relatively small number of
    RMI classes) or online programs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dedicated Department: the schools with the largest and most complete RMI programs often dedicate an entire
      department to the subject. On the other hand, it’s more common for colleges with smaller, less significant
      programs to lump them into their business or finance department.</li>
    <li>Specializations: one key sign that a program’s curriculum has become truly comprehensive is when it starts
      branching into specializations. Schools with so many RMI classes available that they can offer multiple
      variations of the same degree are more likely to appeal to students, too.</li>
    <li>Advanced Program: colleges that have developed their programs to the point that they are attracting graduate
      students – and have faculty engaged in RMI research – send a signal about their dedication to the topic. In
      addition, schools that have achieved this status may be more likely to offer research/experiential learning
      opportunities to undergrads.</li>
    <li>Productivity: the number of RMI degrees that an institution confers in a given year provides an indication of
      how “productive” that program is; larger numbers means more students choosing – and sticking with – the RMI
      major. (This data came from both school websites and College Navigator.)</li>
    <li>Actuarial Excellence: although technically different disciplines, there is significant overlap between risk
      management/insurance and actuarial science in terms of both required knowledge and career options. Schools that
      have earned a designation from the Society of Actuaries as a “College of Actuarial Excellence” demonstrate an
      overall commitment to finance, risk, and insurance education.</li>

    <h3 class="name text-center">1. Temple University - Philadelphia, PA</h3>
    <p class="description">Price, customizability, and quality are the three pillars of Temple University’s Fox School
      of Business, which happens to be one of U.S. News and World Report’s Top 50 undergraduate business schools in the
      country. For this ranking, it was the unusual number of options that Temple provides its RMI students – along
      with the school’s designation as a Center of Actuarial Excellence – that catapulted it to the #1 spot. With
      distinct specializations in Actuarial Science, Healthcare Management, and Risk Management & Insurance, this top
      undergraduate risk management program puts a premium on skill development and industry marketability – while also
      easily outshining its competition.</p>

    <p class="description">Offered through St. John’s University’s Manhattan campus, the Peter J. Tobin College of
      Business provides one of the best insurance and risk management studies programs for globally minded students. In
      addition to the generally cosmopolitan vibe of New York City, RMI students at St. John’s enjoy internships with
      international insurance firms and a variety of study abroad opportunities, including trips to Rome and Paris. St.
      John’s also offers a Quantitative Risk and Insurance (QRI) track within the RMI program itself—an option that
      will help graduates become attractive candidates to global insurance and asset management firms.</p>

    <p class="description">Illinois State University’s two degree tracks in insurance provide students with the
      opportunity to choose between multiple professional specializations in this already highly specialized field. The
      most general option is ISU’s standard bachelor of insurance and risk management degree program, which consists of
      a suite of business and insurance courses that span health, property, liability, risk management, financial
      planning, and more. Alternatively, more technologically adept students can opt for a specialization in Business
      Information Systems. This option places greater emphasis on programming skills and system analysis/design while
      still developing an in-depth understanding of insurance financial services.</p>

    <h3 class="name text-center">4. Olivet College - Olivet, MI</h3>
    <p class="description">Olivet College is one of the few schools with an RMI curriculum so robust that it offers its
      own set of specializations. This means that students will not only acquire a solid understanding of their chosen
      field, but they’ll also customize their education through a “special interest track” in “Agency” or “Insurer.”
      Beyond this, Olivet’s top insurance and risk management major receives plenty of support from its on-campus
      chapter of Gamma Iota Sigma. Indeed, GIS plays a significant role in the RMI degree program, offering a wide
      range of co-curricular activities and opportunities to augment the comprehensive business, insurance, and finance
      core curriculum.</p>

    <h3 class="name text-center">5. Florida State University - Tallahassee, FL</h3>
    <p class="description">Currently ranked among U.S. News’ best business programs nationwide, Florida State
      University’s affordable insurance and risk management studies program already receives plenty of attention – and
      for good reason. Some of the program’s biggest highlights are its excellent graduate job placement rates and
      ample internship and scholarship opportunities—but that’s only the beginning. After all, FSU didn’t stumble upon
      these impressive statistics just by luck; rather, they are the result of a concerted departmental effort to help
      students network and find interviews. In addition to the career center’s targeted professional training services,
      RMI majors can also make connections through a special two-day job fair and placement program known as “Insurance
      Days.”</p>

    <p class="description">Currently, the University of Central Arkansas is the only place in the state to find an
      accredited bachelor’s degree in risk management and insurance. And while this admittedly makes UCA’s the best
      program in Arkansas by default, its high-value package of coursework and extracurriculars would perform just as
      well in a much more competitive arena. Among the most notable benefits are an optional Financial Planning Track
      within the major, an on-campus chapter of Gamma Iota Sigma, and an opportunity to earn a Chartered Property
      Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) Certificate prior to graduating. RMI majors also have access to unique resources –
      including a Student Resume Book – through the university’s Center for Insurance & Risk Management Studies.</p>

    <p class="description">With an average net price of less than $13,000, Ball State University easily qualifies as
      one of the most affordable bachelor of insurance and risk management degree programs in the country. But a cheap
      degree is hardly all Ball State has to offer. In fact, the school provides an impressively comprehensive survey
      of the field, thanks to a curriculum that emphasizes best practices and a faculty with plenty of industry
      experience. What’s more, BSU houses a dedicated Center for Actuarial Science, Insurance, and Risk Management that
      not only provides coursework, but also conducts actuarial research, runs professional-in-residence programs, and
      offers scholarship and internship opportunities for undergraduates.</p>

    <p class="description">Like Utica, Eastern Kentucky University provides two pathways as part of its affordable
      undergraduate risk management programs: a BBA degree and a BS degree in Risk Management and Insurance. The
      differences between the two options are not dramatic – but they’re not entirely cosmetic, either. Most
      significantly, the BBA requires a dedicated business-driven core curriculum, whereas the BS program incorporates
      a more generalized elective schedule. And since EKU is the only school in the state that even offers an undergrad
      RMI program, the fact that it offers two choices just makes the experience that much better for local students
      hoping to enter the field.</p>

    <p class="description">At Utica College, students have two options for earning an affordable bachelor’s degree in
      risk management and insurance. The first and oldest of the two is a management degree with a concentration in
      risk management, which enabled Utica to take the first steps in developing a comprehensive curriculum when RMI
      programs were still exceedingly rare (even today there are only about 60 nationwide). The second and newer of the
      two is a dedicated BS in Risk Management and Insurance, which launched with a full suite of relevant classes –
      and even offers separate concentrations in Insurance and Risk Management.</p>
